This article will explain a simple way in which you can obtain an instance of `java.util.logging.Logger` through dependency injection.

For dependency injection I am going to use the library [Kodein][kodein-di]. If you need an introduction to Kodein, please see [this article][di-article] in this blog.

The purpose of this article is to show you how to create a separate instance of `Logger` for every class, as well as how to automatically disable debug messages in production builds.

## Configuring Kodein

To create a binding for codein, please use the following code:

{% highlight kotlin %}

bind<Logger>() with multiton { tag: String ->
    Logger.getLogger(tag)!!.apply {
        if (!BuildConfig.DEBUG) {
            setFilter { false }
        }
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

This creates a multiton. Accorting to [Kodein documentation][kodein-di]:

> A multiton can be thought of a "singleton factory": it guarantees to always return the same object given the same argument. In other words, for a given argument, the first time a multiton is called with this argument, it will call the function to create an instance; and will always yield that same instance when called with the same argument.

This line assures that a separate instance of `Logger` is created for every class, and that if it is not inside a debug build, it immediately calls the code `setFilter { false }` on it, which prevents any logging at all.

Because it is a multiton, as opposed to a factory that creates a new instance each time an instance is needed, the code setting the filter is invoked only once per every class that uses logging.

## Retrieval

This is a generic function that retrieves multiton instnances using Kodein:

{% highlight kotlin %}

inline fun <reified A, reified T : Any> instance(arg: A): T {
    val result by Kodein.global.instance<A, T>(arg = arg)
    return result
}

{% endhighlight %}

This is how this function is called to retrieve an instance of the Logger:

{% highlight kotlin %}

val Any.log get() = instance<String, Logger>(this::class.java.name)

{% endhighlight %}

Because it is an extension function that extends `Any`, it can be called from all Kotlin classes, and each time it will return exactly one instance per class it was called from.

It is called like this:

{% highlight kotlin %}

class MainActivity: AppCompatActivity() {

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

        log.info("line 1")
        log.info("line 2")
        log.info("line 3")
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

Because it is a multiton, only one instance of `Logger` is created in the above code. Furthermode, because of the way Kodein is configured, if this is called from a production build, no debug messages will be produced.

You can see logging and dependency injection being used this way in my project [Victor-Events][events].
