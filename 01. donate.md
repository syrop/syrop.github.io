This is my professional blog. However, I have spent countless hours on contributing to open source, to create production-quality projects you can now download from [my Google Play page][play].

I have specifically declined monetizing my projects, because I want to give people a chance to get to know who I am, or what I stand for, before they choose to interact with me professionally, and there is no better way to do it than by allowing them to see my code, and to install my apps directly from [Google Play][play].

Other than sending information about this blog, and my projects, to potential employers, I use my repositories to train my own skills, or to have code that is readily-available, designed and tested by me, whenever I start another project, professional or otherwise.

The code had been through several revisions, since I began to learn Kotlin in 2017, when I decided to sum up in this blog the design patterns I've came up with throughout the process.

If you are **not** one of the people I have sent my CV to, but are simply using this blog to learn, or to use snippets of my code in your own projects, please consider making a small donation in bitcoin. Thank you.
