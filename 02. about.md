This is the blog of my professional portfolio. You can find here explanations of the design patterns I use.

I have experience working professionally with a back-end wallet of cryptocurrencies (zcash, ethereum classic), and I can be paid in bitcoin.

My motivation to work is bringing to mobile devices the services that have been so far only available on larger machines or not at all.
